    <h1>Welcome to the class roster exercise!</h1>
    <p>For this exercise you will be making a very simple web app that contains an array of student names in a js file. The website will prompt you for four possible commands: add remove display, and quit. This web page will prompt the user for one of the commands. Here is what each command should do:

add: will then create a prompt for a student name request. Then add this name to the student to the array of student names in the js file remove will create a prompt for a student name request. Then remove this name from the roster array display: will print out the roster using console.log

quit:will end the while loop of prompts.

Watch the lecture video for an example of how it should work. Also make sure to change the script src file to your own is file!</p>
